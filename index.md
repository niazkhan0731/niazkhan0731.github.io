# 👋 Hi, I’m Niaz Khan  

Welcome to my **ePortfolio**, where I showcase enhanced projects that demonstrate my technical growth across  
**Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms & Data Structures**, and **Databases**.

---

## 🧠 About Me
I’m a **Technology Analyst at Interpublic Group (IPG)**, providing enterprise-level IT management and support for more than 2,000 global users, including senior executives. My work centers on ensuring reliable endpoint performance, driving **digital and AI transformation**, and optimizing enterprise infrastructure during large-scale migrations such as IPG’s transition under Omnicom.

I recently **graduated *cum laude* with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** from **Southern New Hampshire University**, where I specialized in **software engineering**, **algorithmic problem-solving**, and **database design**. My academic projects include Android app development, reinforcement learning agents, and full-stack data dashboards.

These experiences have strengthened my passion for bridging IT operations with software development to deliver scalable, automated, and intelligent enterprise solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging AI tools, experimenting with automation, developing personal tech projects, cooking keto recipes, and analyzing market data for strategic insights.
