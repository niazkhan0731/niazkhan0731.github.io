# 👋 Hi, I’m Niaz Khan  

Welcome to my **ePortfolio**, where I showcase enhanced projects that demonstrate my technical growth in  
**Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms & Data Structures**, and **Databases**.

---

## 🧠 About Me
I currently serve as a **Technology Analyst at Interpublic Group (IPG)**, providing enterprise-level IT support and system management for over 2,000 corporate and agency users, including executives. My role involves ensuring seamless IT operations, optimizing infrastructure, and driving **digital and AI transformation initiatives**. During IPG’s transition under Omnicom, I played a key role in aligning IT systems and processes with the new organizational structure.

Through this experience, I’ve developed strong expertise in **enterprise IT strategy**, **system integration**, and **project leadership**, positioning me for continued growth into technical leadership roles overseeing enterprise-wide IT initiatives.

In parallel, I’m completing my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at **Southern New Hampshire University (graduating October 2025)**. My coursework has strengthened my skills in **software engineering**, **algorithmic problem-solving**, and **database design**, with projects spanning Android app development, reinforcement learning, and full-stack dashboards.

Outside of work and study, I stay curious and creative — experimenting with AI tools, building personal tech projects, exploring new keto recipes, and analyzing market data to improve decision-making and strategy.
