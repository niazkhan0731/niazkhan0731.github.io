## üß≠ Professional Self-Assessment

My journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been a transformational experience that shaped not only my technical abilities but also my professional identity. Entering this program as an IT professional, I initially viewed computer science through a practical lens of support, troubleshooting, and infrastructure. Over time, the coursework deepened my perspective, and I began to approach technology through the eyes of a problem solver, engineer, and creator. This ePortfolio represents that evolution‚Äîfrom managing systems to designing them.

Throughout the program, I developed skills across key domains of computer science, including software engineering, algorithms, database systems, security principles, and collaborative problem solving. Each artifact included in this portfolio reflects not just academic completion, but personal growth and readiness for real-world application. Coursework in data structures and algorithms challenged me to think more abstractly, improving my ability to reason through complexity and evaluate solutions based on efficiency and scalability. Courses like CS-340 and CS-360 gave me practical exposure to full-stack development and mobile architecture, strengthening my confidence in building functional applications from the ground up.

The capstone experience required me to re-engage with past projects through a professional lens, enhancing them to meet industry standards. This process helped me refine my approach to writing maintainable code, implementing validation and security measures, and designing with users in mind. My software design artifact, the Event Tracker App, demonstrates my growth in creating modular architecture, UI/UX consistency, and persistent data handling in Android development. My algorithms artifact, the Reinforcement Learning project, highlights my ability to implement complex decision-making models using Deep Q-Learning and iterative optimization. My database artifact, the Animal Shelter Dashboard, exemplifies my ability to integrate backend data systems with interactive visualization, enabling data-driven insights for stakeholders.

Beyond technical proficiency, this program strengthened my ability to collaborate, communicate, and lead. Working as a Technology Analyst at Interpublic Group, I regularly support enterprise users and coordinate with cross-functional teams. The skills gained in my coursework‚Äîsuch as writing documentation, explaining technical concepts, and presenting data clearly‚Äîdirectly enhanced my effectiveness in that role. I learned to translate complex solutions into accessible language, an essential skill for bridging technical and non-technical environments. These experiences reinforced the importance of designing with the end user in mind, and this mindset influenced how I approached every Capstone enhancement.

Security awareness was another core outcome I developed. Courses such as Secure Coding and project enhancements required me to think critically about vulnerabilities, data validation, and responsible access control. Whether applying input validation in a CRUD system or refining authentication logic in a mobile app, I consistently worked to ensure that usability did not come at the expense of safety. This mindset is essential in modern computing, where software must be both functional and trustworthy.

This program also shaped my professional goals. While my career began in IT operations, my Capstone journey helped me recognize my passion for building solutions, not just supporting them. I now aim to progress into advanced engineering roles‚Äîsuch as Systems Engineer, Full-Stack Developer, or Solutions Architect‚Äîwhere I can design systems that improve user experience and organizational efficiency. My long-term goal is to contribute to enterprise transformation, integrating automation, AI, and scalable architectures to deliver impactful solutions.

The artifacts in this portfolio fit together as evidence of my readiness to enter the next stage of my career. They demonstrate my ability to design full applications, implement machine learning models, and develop secure database-driven systems. More importantly, they reflect my commitment to continuous improvement, problem solving, and real-world impact. This portfolio is not just a collection of projects‚Äîit is the culmination of my evolution from support technician to computer scientist, and a foundation I will continue to build upon as I advance in the field.

## üß† About Me
I currently serve as a **Technology Analyst at Interpublic Group (IPG)**, providing enterprise-level IT support and system management for over 2,000 corporate and agency users, including executives. My role involves ensuring seamless IT operations, optimizing infrastructure, and driving **digital and AI transformation initiatives**. During IPG‚Äôs transition under Omnicom, I played a key role in aligning IT systems and processes with the new organizational structure.

Through this experience, I‚Äôve developed strong expertise in **enterprise IT strategy**, **system integration**, and **project leadership**, positioning me for continued growth into technical leadership roles overseeing enterprise-wide IT initiatives.

In parallel, I‚Äôm completing my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at **Southern New Hampshire University (graduating October 2025)**. My coursework has strengthened my skills in **software engineering**, **algorithmic problem-solving**, and **database design**, with projects spanning Android app development, reinforcement learning, and full-stack dashboards.

Outside of work and study, I stay curious and creative ‚Äî experimenting with AI tools, building personal tech projects, exploring new keto recipes, and analyzing market data to improve decision-making and strategy.
