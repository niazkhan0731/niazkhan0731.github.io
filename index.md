# Hi, I’m Niaz 👋

Welcome to my **Computer Science Capstone (CS-499)** ePortfolio.  

This site highlights enhanced projects demonstrating my skills in **Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms & Data Structures**, and **Databases**.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I currently serve as a **Technology Analyst at Interpublic Group (IPG)** where I provide support to over 2,000 corporate and agency end users, including executives. My role involves ensuring seamless IT operations, optimizing infrastructure, and driving digital AI transformation initiatives. During IPG’s transition under Omnicom, I played a critical role in aligning IT systems and solutions with the new organizational structure.  

Through this experience, I have gained hands-on expertise in **enterprise IT strategy**, **system integration**, and **project leadership**, positioning me for continued growth into leadership roles overseeing enterprise-wide IT strategies.  

In parallel with my professional work, I am completing my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at Southern New Hampshire University (graduating October 2025). 

My academic focus has strengthened my skills in **software engineering**, **algorithmic problem-solving**, and **database systems**, with projects ranging from Android app development to reinforcement learning agents and full-stack data dashboards.  

Outside of work and study, I stay curious and active — experimenting with AI tools, creating new keto recipes in the kitchen, and trading stock to sharpen my decision-making skills.  

### 🔑 Core Strengths
