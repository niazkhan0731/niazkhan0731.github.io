## ðŸŽ“ Reflection
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Apply **software engineering principles** to real-world mobile apps.  
- Work with **algorithms and data structures** (SQLite queries, validation, event handling).  
- Improve an existing artifact through **iteration and enhancement**.  

It is included in my **CS-499 Capstone Portfolio** to showcase my skills in **mobile development, data persistence, and system design**.
