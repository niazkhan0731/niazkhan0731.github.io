# üìÖ Event Tracker App (CS-499 Artifact)

## Overview
The **Event Tracker App** is an Android application built in **Java** using **Android Studio**.  
It was originally developed as part of the **CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming** course to demonstrate **mobile UI design, SQLite persistence, and notifications**.  
For my **CS-499 Computer Science Capstone**, I enhanced this artifact to strengthen my skills in **software engineering, mobile development, and algorithms/data structures**.

## ‚ú® Features
- **User Authentication**: Login and registration screens for secure access.  
- **Event Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view personal events.  
- **Grid-Based UI**: Events displayed in a clear, grid-style layout.  
- **SQLite Storage**: Events persist locally on the device.  
- **Notifications**: Users receive reminders for upcoming events.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Original Implementation
The original app demonstrated:
- A functional Android **UI with XML layouts**.  
- **Local data persistence** using SQLite.  
- A basic **notification system** triggered from events.  
- Full CRUD operations for event records.  

This baseline project provided a strong demonstration of **mobile app fundamentals** but left room for scalability and structural improvement.

## üöÄ Enhancements (CS-499)
As part of my **Capstone portfolio**, I enhanced the app with the following improvements:

1. **Code Organization & Maintainability**
   - Refactored activity and database logic for cleaner separation of concerns.  
   - Improved variable naming, comments, and error handling for readability.  

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Redesigned layouts for a more consistent, professional look.  
   - Improved input validation on login and event creation screens.  

3. **Data Handling & Algorithms**
   - Optimized database queries for faster event lookups.  
   - Added safeguards against duplicate entries.  

4. **Notifications & Permissions**
   - Improved notification scheduling logic.  
   - Enhanced runtime permission handling for Android SMS/notifications.

## üéì Reflection
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Apply **software engineering principles** to real-world mobile apps.  
- Work with **algorithms and data structures** (SQLite queries, validation, event handling).  
- Improve an existing artifact through **iteration and enhancement**.  

It is included in my **CS-499 Capstone Portfolio** to showcase my skills in **mobile development, data persistence, and system design**.
