# ðŸ“† Event Tracker App (Android)
*Software Design & Engineering Artifact*

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project was developed for **CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming**.  
It is an Android mobile application that allows users to log in, register, and manage personal events stored in a local **SQLite** database. The app emphasizes a clean, user-centered design.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Selected This Project
I chose the Event Tracker App as my **Software Design & Engineering artifact** because it demonstrates:
- Mobile app development with **Java** and **Android Studio**
- UI/UX design principles applied to mobile layouts
- CRUD operations with **SQLite**
- User interaction flows such as login, register, and event management

---

## ðŸ”§ Planned Enhancements (Capstone)
- Improve **UI/UX consistency** with polished layouts and accessibility checks  
- Add stronger **input validation** and error handling across login and event forms  
- Refactor architecture to better separate **UI, logic, and data access**  
- Expand **testing coverage** with manual and automated cases
