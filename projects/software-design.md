# 📆 Event Tracker App (Android)
*Software Design & Engineering Artifact*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Event Tracker App** was originally developed for **CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming** and later enhanced during **CS-499: Computer Science Capstone**.  
It is an Android mobile application that allows users to **register, log in, and manage personal events** using a local **SQLite** database. The app focuses on a clean, accessible design with intuitive navigation and persistent data storage.

## 🎯 Why I Selected This Project
I selected this project as my **Software Design & Engineering artifact** because it demonstrates practical, real-world mobile development skills including:
- Building native Android apps with **Java** and **Android Studio**
- Applying **UI/UX design principles** for usability and visual hierarchy  
- Implementing **CRUD operations** through SQLite for persistent local storage  
- Designing user flows such as login, registration, and event management

This project highlights my ability to design modular code, maintain scalability, and deliver a seamless user experience in mobile environments.

## ⚙️ Capstone Enhancements
During the CS-499 Capstone, I improved the Event Tracker App to demonstrate stronger software engineering and design principles:
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Redesigned layouts using Material Design components  
- **Input Validation:** Added error handling for login and form submission fields  
- **Architecture Refinement:** Improved code separation between UI, logic, and database layers  
- **Performance & Testing:** Optimized queries and validated CRUD operations for reliability
