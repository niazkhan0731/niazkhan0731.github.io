# 📆 Event Tracker App (Android)  
*Software Design & Engineering Artifact – CS-499 Capstone*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Event Tracker App** was originally developed in **CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming** and later enhanced in **CS-499: Computer Science Capstone**. It is a native Android application that enables users to **register, log in, and manage personal events** using a local **SQLite database**.

The app emphasizes clean interface design, modular logic, and persistent user data. Core features include:
- User authentication (registration and login)
- Event creation, editing, and deletion (CRUD)
- Local data persistence with SQLite
- Intuitive navigation using Android activities

## 🎯 Why I Selected This Artifact
I selected this project as my **Software Design & Engineering** artifact because it showcases my ability to:
- Build real-world mobile applications using **Java and Android Studio**
- Apply **UI/UX design principles** for usability and accessibility
- Architect modular code with separation between UI, logic, and data layers
- Implement full CRUD functionality using SQLite database integration

This artifact represents my understanding of software engineering fundamentals, interface design, and the complete mobile development lifecycle.

## ⚙️ Capstone Enhancements (CS-499)
During the capstone, I enhanced the project to demonstrate stronger engineering practices and improved design quality:

- **UI/UX Refinement**  
  Introduced Material Design components for improved layout, consistency, and readability

- **Input Validation & Error Handling**  
  Added form validation for login/registration and prevented invalid event submissions

- **Code Architecture Improvements**  
  Refactored activities and database logic for cleaner separation of concerns (Activity → Helper → Database)

- **Reliability & Testing Enhancements**  
  Verified database CRUD operations and optimized data handling for stability

## 🧠 Skills and Growth Demonstrated
Through this artifact, I strengthened key software engineering competencies:

- **Modular Application Design** using structured Android components  
- **Persistent Data Management** using SQLite  
- **User-Centered Design (UI/UX)** aligned with usability standards  
- **Lifecycle Development** from concept and prototype to final deployment and debugging  

This project helped me understand how to design maintainable, user-focused applications that perform reliably on mobile platforms.
