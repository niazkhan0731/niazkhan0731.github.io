# 🗄️ Animal Shelter CRUD + Dashboard (MongoDB & Dash)
*Databases Artifact*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project was created for **CS-340: Client/Server Development**. It provides an **interactive dashboard** for Grazioso Salvare, an organization training dogs for search-and-rescue. Built with **Python, Dash, and MongoDB**, the dashboard allows users to filter animal records, visualize adoption outcomes, and view geolocated office markers.

Key features:
- Interactive **DataTable** for querying animal records  
- **Leaflet map** with geolocated data points  
- Outcome-based **charts** (bar/pie)  
- Reusable **CRUD Python module (`animal_shelter.py`)** for MongoDB

## 🎯 Why I Selected This Project
I chose this as my **Databases artifact** because it demonstrates:
- A modular and reusable **CRUD layer**  
- Practical **data visualization** with Dash  
- Integration of database queries into a live dashboard  
- Use of real-world animal shelter data for decision-making

## 🔧 Planned Enhancements (Capstone)
During the Capstone, I will enhance this project by:
- Expanding CRUD with **data validation and error handling**  
- Adding advanced **aggregation queries** for analytics  
- Optimizing **indexes** and database performance  
- Improving the **dashboard UI** for usability and accessibility
