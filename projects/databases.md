# 🗄️ Animal Shelter CRUD + Dashboard (MongoDB & Dash)  
*Databases Artifact – CS-499 Capstone*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project was originally built in **CS-340: Client/Server Development** and later enhanced for the **CS-499 Computer Science Capstone**. It provides an interactive data dashboard for *Grazioso Salvare*, an organization focused on identifying search-and-rescue dogs.

The system includes:
- A **Python CRUD module (`animal_shelter.py`)** for secure database operations  
- A **Dash analytics dashboard** for exploring adoption and outcome trends  
- Integration with a **MongoDB database** containing real shelter records  

The dashboard enables users to query, filter, visualize, and map animal data to support operational decision-making.

## 🎯 Why I Selected This Artifact
I chose this artifact because it demonstrates my growth in **database engineering and full-stack data applications**. It highlights my ability to design secure CRUD services, implement real-time data filtering, and build analytical dashboards that support non-technical stakeholders—skills directly applicable to professional software and data roles.

## ⚙️ Capstone Enhancements (CS-499)
During the capstone, I enhanced this project to improve performance, scalability, and usability:

- **Migrated MongoDB** to a secure local environment  
- Added **advanced search filters** for breed, age, sex, and outcome  
- Implemented **aggregation functions** for statistical insights and charts  
- Improved the **Dash interface** with dynamic UI controls and layout refinements  
- Strengthened **data validation and error handling** within CRUD operations

## 🧠 Skills and Growth Demonstrated
This artifact strengthened my capabilities in:

- **Database design and optimization** (indexing, aggregation, validation)  
- **Backend integration** using PyMongo and reusable CRUD functions  
- **Data visualization** with Dash and Plotly components  
- **Security-focused development** with controlled data access and sanitization  

Through this process, I learned how to transform backend systems into meaningful analytic tools.
