# üóÑÔ∏è Animal Shelter CRUD + Dashboard (MongoDB & Dash)
*Databases Artifact*

---

## üìñ Project Overview
This artifact was originally developed for **CS-340: Client/Server Development** and later enhanced during the **CS-499 Capstone**.  
It provides an **interactive analytics dashboard** for *Grazioso Salvare*, an organization that identifies and trains dogs for search-and-rescue operations.  

Built using **Python, Dash, and MongoDB**, the project combines a robust back-end CRUD interface with a data visualization dashboard. Users can filter, query, and visualize animal data to make informed adoption and training decisions.

Key features include:
- Interactive **DataTable** for viewing and filtering animal records  
- **Leaflet map** for displaying animal geolocations  
- **Plotly charts** for visualizing breed and outcome data  
- Reusable **CRUD Python module (`animal_shelter.py`)** for database operations

## üéØ Why I Selected This Project
I selected this as my **Databases artifact** because it demonstrates:
- Design and implementation of a **modular database CRUD system** in Python  
- Integration of **data retrieval and visualization** through Dash  
- Ability to connect **MongoDB queries** to real-time analytical dashboards  
- Practical application of data-driven insights using real shelter outcome data  

This project bridges the gap between database logic and front-end visualization, showcasing how structured data can drive meaningful insights for non-technical users.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Capstone Enhancements
During the capstone, I enhanced the Animal Shelter Dashboard to strengthen database performance and usability:
- **Migrated MongoDB** from a hosted environment to a secure **local instance**  
- Added **query filters** for faster search and optimized record retrieval  
- Improved **chart and map interactivity** within the Dash app  
- Enhanced **code modularity** for maintainability and readability  
- Refined **UI layout** to improve visual clarity and user flow

## üí° Key Learning Outcomes
This artifact demonstrates advanced proficiency in:
- **Database management** and CRUD operations using PyMongo  
- **Data visualization and interactivity** through Dash and Plotly  
- **Full-stack integration** between data models and client interfaces  
- **Scalable system design** using modular, reusable components  

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of how to design efficient database systems and connect them with front-end interfaces that communicate complex data effectively.
