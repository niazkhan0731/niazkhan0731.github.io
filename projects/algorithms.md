# ðŸ¤– Reinforcement Learning Projects (CartPole & Pirate Maze)
*Algorithms & Data Structures Artifact*

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Emerging Trends in Computer Science** course. It demonstrates the application of **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **deep Q-learning** to train an intelligent agent capable of navigating an environment, maximizing rewards, and avoiding penalties.

The main artifact is a **Jupyter Notebook (`TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`)** implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm. Supporting files define the grid environment (`TreasureEnvironment.py`) and experience replay system (`GameExperience.py`).

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Selected This Project
I chose this as my **Algorithms & Data Structures artifact** because it highlights:
- Implementation of **deep Q-learning** and neural networks  
- Use of **experience replay** and epsilon-greedy exploration  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** (learning rate, discount factor, exploration decay)  
- Convergence validation and performance evaluation  

This project shows both algorithmic problem-solving and practical reinforcement learning skills.

## ðŸ”§ Planned Enhancements (Capstone)
During the Capstone, I will enhance this project by:
- Optimizing the **training loop** for faster convergence  
- Adding improved **reward normalization** and performance tracking  
- Expanding documentation with **before/after charts** of learning curves  
- Including more detailed **explanation of algorithmic design trade-offs**

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots (Coming Soon)
Visualizations of training reward progress and agent success rates will be added here.
