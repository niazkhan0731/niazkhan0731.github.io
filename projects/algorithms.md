# 🤖 Reinforcement Learning Projects (CartPole & Pirate Maze)
*Algorithms & Data Structures Artifact*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This artifact was developed for **CS-370: Emerging Trends in Computer Science** and later enhanced during the **CS-499 Capstone**.  
It demonstrates the implementation of **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **deep Q-learning** to train an intelligent agent that navigates an environment, maximizes rewards, and avoids penalties.

The main artifact is a **Jupyter Notebook (`TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`)** implementing the Deep Q-Learning algorithm. Supporting scripts include:
- `TreasureEnvironment.py` – defines the 8×8 grid environment and reward logic  
- `GameExperience.py` – handles experience replay memory and training data sampling

## 🎯 Why I Selected This Project
I selected this as my **Algorithms & Data Structures artifact** because it showcases my ability to:
- Apply **neural network algorithms** to solve optimization problems  
- Implement **deep Q-learning** with epsilon-greedy exploration  
- Manage **state-action values**, policy updates, and convergence criteria  
- Tune **hyperparameters** such as learning rate, discount factor, and exploration decay  

This project emphasizes algorithmic reasoning, iterative model design, and real-world applications of machine learning principles.

## ⚙️ Capstone Enhancements
During the capstone, I enhanced the original project by:
- **Optimizing the training loop** for faster convergence and reduced variance  
- **Adding reward normalization** and adaptive learning rate logic  
- **Improving performance visualization** using reward history and success-rate tracking  
- **Expanding documentation** to explain algorithmic design trade-offs and reinforcement strategies

## 💡 Key Learning Outcomes
This artifact demonstrates mastery in:
- **Algorithm design and optimization** through applied reinforcement learning  
- **Data structure management** for experience replay and policy memory  
- **Neural network implementation** for dynamic state evaluation  
- **Problem-solving under uncertainty**, balancing exploration and exploitation
